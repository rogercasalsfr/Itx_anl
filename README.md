**Immunotherapy trajectory inference**

This project investigates the dynamics of T cell differentiation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) using single-cell RNA sequencing data (GEO123813) from patients pre- and post-therapy. Through trajectory inference, functional characterization, and regulon analysis, it aims to uncover key mechanisms and drivers of the immune T cell response to anti-PD1 therapy.
